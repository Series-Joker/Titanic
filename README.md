# AppliedNeuralNetworkTitanicSurvival
This notebook applies the architecture from Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization from Coursera on the Titanic Survival data set from kaggle.
Please refer to the Medium post for instructions how to adjust the network to suit your binary classification problem.

You can find the "Deep Neural Network Application - v3" and "dnn_utils_v2.py" in the programming assignments from week 4.
Download both notebooks and save them locally. If you're using the code from this repo, please copy and paste the code from the L_layer_model function into the corresponding cell.

You can download the Titanic Survival data sets from kaggle here:
